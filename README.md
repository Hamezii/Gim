# Gim
This game (codenamed Gim) is a turn-based roguelike dungeon-crawler.
The aim  is to fight through a dungeon and defeat a boss on floor 12.

So far there are 3 different playable characters and around 9 or 10 different types of enemies, but I'm hoping to add more later!

As for saving, the game saves your progress at the start of every level, so you can leave and come back later.

## Controls
Arrow keys/WASD to move.

Z - open inventory / select

X - close menus

Plus / Minus - Zoom in and out (useful for when you're trying to find where to go)

Escape - Return to main menu / exit

## Dependencies
In order to play this game, you will need to have at least Python 3.6.x installed as well as pygame. 
Execute the file named gim.pyw to start the game.

If anyone would like an executable version, I am happy to send one.
Any suggestions as to where to put an executable aside from in the source code would be appreciated!
